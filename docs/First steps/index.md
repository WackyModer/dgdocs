# 1. Materials required

In this tutorial you will learn to setup and code a basic mod for desktop goose.
Remember! This takes time and effort, so not really for the faint of heart.

## What you need

* ###**You need to know how to code in C#** 
To, y'know, **code**. If you don't know how to code and you still want to participate in this, you can follow this tutorial [**here**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N775KsWQVkw&list=PLPV2KyIb3jR4CtEelGPsmPzlvP7ISPYzR) to learn to code in C#, and follow Brackeys C# course, and remember, don't fall into tutorial hell.




* ###**Have the Desktop Goose program** 
This will be useful in the tutorial

* ###**A proper IDE for C#, I use Visual Studio 2022, but a Jetbrains product would work, VSC will not work (At the time of writing)** 
This gives you code highlighting, errors before you compile your code, auto complete, and as a cherry on top, you can compile in it.
